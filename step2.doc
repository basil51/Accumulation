What is NOW correct (good progress)

Your current request:

{
  "category": ["erc20"],
  "withMetadata": true,
  "excludeZeroValue": true,
  "fromBlock": "0x16df8a9",
  "toBlock": "0x16e6c6f",
  "contractAddresses": ["0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce"],
  "maxCount": "0x64",
  "pageKey": "25cffa39-9a0d-4f4c-a4a8-6826cc32b393"
}


✔ excludeZeroValue: true → fixed zero-USD noise
✔ maxCount present → avoids silent truncation
✔ pageKey present → pagination implemented (very good)
✔ Contract address correct (SHIB)
✔ Block range reasonable

Alchemy will respond correctly to this request.

So yes: Cursor fixed the API-level bugs.

❌ CRITICAL PROBLEM (this still blocks signals)
🚫 You are paginating BEFORE wallet targeting

Right now your query still means:

“Give me any SHIB ERC20 transfers in this block range”

Even with pagination:

you’re scanning random global SHIB traffic

most transfers are:

DEX trades

internal routing

dust

almost none represent accumulation

So your engine:

sees many unrelated wallets

no wallet crosses accumulation thresholds

→ zero signals

This is expected behavior.

❌ LOGIC ERROR (very important)
🚫 pageKey must NOT be reused across different block windows

Your log shows:

"fromBlock": "0x16df8a9",
"toBlock": "0x16e6c6f",
"pageKey": "25cffa39-9a0d-4f4c-a4a8-6826cc32b393"


⚠️ pageKey is ONLY valid for the exact previous response
If:

block range changes

params change

or a new scan cycle starts

➡️ pageKey MUST be reset to undefined

Otherwise:

Alchemy returns empty pages

silently

no error

This alone can explain:

“I still don’t get any signals”

🔥 THE REAL FIX (non-optional)
You MUST switch to a 2-stage architecture

Your current approach = ❌ bottom-up
Correct approach = ✅ top-down

✅ Stage 1 — Wallet Discovery (MANDATORY)

Goal: find wallets worth tracking

Correct query
{
  "category": ["erc20"],
  "contractAddresses": ["0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce"],
  "fromBlock": "latest-50000",
  "excludeZeroValue": true,
  "maxCount": "0x3e8"
}


Then:

group by to

sum value

count txs

keep top N wallets

⚠️ No USD filtering here

✅ Stage 2 — Accumulation Detection (PER WALLET)

Only now you do:

{
  "category": ["erc20"],
  "contractAddresses": ["SHIB"],
  "toAddress": "0xWALLET",
  "fromBlock": "latest-200000",
  "excludeZeroValue": true
}


Then compute:

net = received - sent
duration = lastTx - firstTx
txCount

✅ Correct accumulation trigger (example)
if (
  netUsd >= 50_000 &&
  txCount >= 3 &&
  duration >= 24h
) {
  EMIT_SIGNAL
}

🚨 Summary verdict
Item	Status
Alchemy URL	✅ Correct
API params	✅ Valid
Pagination	⚠️ Misused
Zero-value noise	✅ Fixed
Wallet targeting	❌ Missing
Accumulation logic	❌ Not implemented
✅ What to do NEXT (important)

Please answer one of these (your choice):

1️⃣ Paste the accumulation detection code (or pseudo-code)
2️⃣ Tell me:

do you store transfers in DB?

or process them streaming?

I will then:

redesign the logic

fix pagination safely

and guarantee real accumulation signals start appearing

You’re no longer debugging Alchemy — you’re debugging strategy.
