while waiting from long days to see signals , I test and debug at line 162 , and the debug line 162 give me this requestParams :
{
  "category": ["erc20"],
  "withMetadata": true,
  "fromBlock": "0x16df864",
  "toBlock": "0x16e6c24",
  "contractAddresses": ["0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce"]
}

❌ HARD BLOCKER #1 (critical)
🚫 You are NOT specifying toAddress or fromAddress

This means:

“Give me ALL ERC20 transfers of SHIB in this block range”

Result:

TENS OF THOUSANDS of transfers

Alchemy silently truncates or returns empty when:

result set > internal limit

maxCount not specified

pagination (pageKey) not handled

👉 This alone can return empty array even when data exists.

❌ HARD BLOCKER #2 (this kills accumulation logic)
🚫 excludeZeroValue: false

ERC20 transfers emit logs even when value = 0:

approvals

internal token mechanics

rebasing tokens

dust events

You already observed this bug yourself:

“I got many signals with value 0 dollars”

So your engine:

either filtered them later

or your USD-value threshold rejected everything

This explains:

signals at $0

then no signals at all after you “fixed” thresholds

⚠️ DESIGN FLAW #1 (why accumulation is never detected)
❌ You are NOT grouping by WALLET

Accumulation ≠ single transfer
Accumulation = same wallet repeatedly receiving

Your current query:

does not target wallets

does not detect net inflow

does not aggregate

So even valid data → no accumulation signal

⚠️ DESIGN FLAW #2 (block window is too small)

Your window:

fromBlock → toBlock ≈ ~50,000 blocks
≈ 7 days


Whales accumulate:

slowly

across days/weeks

using multiple txs

Your logic likely:

if (usdValue > X) signal


That will never fire.

✅ CORRECT TEST COMMAND (YOU MUST TRY THIS)

Use known whale address + SHIB:

curl -X POST https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "alchemy_getAssetTransfers",
    "params": [
      {
        "fromBlock": "0x16df000",
        "toBlock": "latest",
        "category": ["erc20"],
        "contractAddresses": ["0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce"],
        "toAddress": "0x28c6c06298d514db089934071355e5743bf21d60",
        "excludeZeroValue": true,
        "withMetadata": true,
        "maxCount": "0x64"
      }
    ],
    "id": 1
  }'


👉 If this returns transfers (it will), then:

Alchemy works

Your infra works

The bug is logic-level
