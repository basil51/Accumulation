I need you to act as a senior backend debugger.

My system produces either:
- many signals with amountUSD = 0
- or zero signals when thresholds are restored

Your task:
1. Trace the entire detection flow:
   ingestion → normalization → scoring → signal creation
2. Identify all code paths where amountUSD could become 0 or undefined
3. Add a Signal Debug Inspector:
   - logs rule-by-rule evaluation
   - outputs why a transaction did or did not trigger a signal
4. Add guardrails:
   - forbid USD-based rules if price or liquidity missing
   - prevent zero-value scoring
5. Propose fixes without breaking current architecture

Start by scanning:
- normalization logic
- detection_engine rules
- scoring normalization
- threshold comparisons
