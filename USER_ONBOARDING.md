## Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results

1. **Start with Popular Coins**: Add well-known coins (ETH, BTC) to test
2. **Set Appropriate Thresholds**: Higher thresholds = fewer but higher quality alerts
3. **Monitor False Positives**: Report false positives to improve accuracy
4. **Use Multiple Chains**: Explore coins across different blockchains
5. **Review Signal Details**: Check evidence to understand why signals were triggered

### Signal Quality

- **High Scores (75+)**: Most reliable, focus on these
- **Medium Scores (60-74)**: Worth monitoring, may need verification
- **Low Scores (0-59)**: Candidate signals, use for research

### Watchlist Strategy

- **Diversify**: Add coins from different chains
- **Focus Areas**: Concentrate on coins you're actively trading
- **Update Regularly**: Remove coins you're no longer interested in
